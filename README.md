# vanilla-js-fastapi-webapp
A simple webapp template designed to work with docker, cloudflare tunneling and Traefik for the reverse proxy. The frontend is vanilla javascript for optimal performance and because LLM's are trained on lots of Javascript code and who wants to actually do frontend anymore.
